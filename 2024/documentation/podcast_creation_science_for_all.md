    Title: 
    Transcriptional profiling of livers from mice flown on Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 (RRRM-1)

    Description:
    In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-1), forty female BALB/cAnNTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 10-12 week-old and twenty 32 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 22-23 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 40 days and allowed to recover for 2 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice sacrificed 1 day after launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-1 included a total of 160 mice. This datasets features ribodepleted total RNA-seq data from livers dissected from all groups in RRRM-1. Data from 7-10 livers per group are included. All samples include either Mix 1 or Mix 2 of the ERCC spike-in control.

    Protocol Type
    Animal Husbandry
    Description
    All mice (BALB/cAnNTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-4 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-3 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water was changed weekly and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages. At L-10 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and with regard to establishing similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. Mold contamination of food: Spaceflight and Habitat Ground Control mice were exposed to mold in their food to unknown relative degrees. The Vivarium Control and Baseline Control mice had clean food throughout their habitation. Loose food bars: Food bars came loose and fell to the bottom of the cage for the HGC mice and was free floating for the Spaceflight mice. This did not prevent the mice from eating. This may have caused some degree of stress for these animals that would have been experienced differently between the Spaceflight and HGC groups. Live animal return: Because weather in the Pacific was very poor, mice experienced double density housing (10 per cage instead of 5) for at least 7 days instead of the expected 2-3 days. Habitat Ground Control mice were treated the same way but this duration of double-density housing probably created additional stress on both groups of mice. In addition, because of rough seas, the Spaceflight mice might have experienced some sea sickness-type conditions that would not have been experienced by the HGC mice.

    Protocol Type
    Sample Collection
    Description
    Live Animal Return (LAR) liver samples: Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. The liver was removed, weighed, dissected into individual lobes (1- left/right medial, 2- left lateral and 3- remaining lobes) and snap frozen on liquid nitrogen. Tissues were frozen within 10-16 minutes of thoracotomy procedure. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically. Liver samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage during transportation and shipment. ISS Terminal (ISS-T) liver samples: Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. The spleen was dissected fresh from each carcass and placed in a tube containing RNA Later. The carcass was then wrapped in foil and frozen in MELFI on board the ISS or in ground -80C freezers. Carcasses were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage on board the ISS, in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment. For liver dissection, carcasses were thawed at room temperature one at a time (staggered) until the tissues were sufficiently pliable for dissection (approximately 60-90 minutes). Once thawed, the liver was removed from each carcass, weighed, dissected into individual lobes (1- left/right medial, 2- left lateral and 3- remaining lobes) and snap frozen on liquid nitrogen. Liver samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment.

    **Title:**  
    Studying the liver cells of mice that were flown to space.

    **Description:**  
    In this research, 40 female mice were sent to the International Space Station (ISS) to study the effects of space on their bodies. The mice were of two different ages: 20 young mice (10-12 weeks old) and 20 older mice (32 weeks old). Half of each group (10 young and 10 old) were euthanized in space after being there for 22-23 days. The other half returned to Earth after 40 days in space, rested for 2 days, and were then euthanized. Scientists also had ground control groups of mice to compare the results with those kept on Earth under similar conditions. This study focused on analyzing RNA (a type of genetic material) from the livers of these mice to see how space travel impacted their livers. They analyzed liver samples from 7-10 mice in each group.

    **Protocols**

    **Animal Care:**  
    All the mice were from a company in New York and were equipped with tracking chips. They were sent to NASA for space travel preparations. The mice lived in cages with 5 mice each and were fed standard food and water, with their health monitored daily. Three weeks before launch, they were placed in special cages that mimicked the space environment. Ten days before launch, the mice were grouped into larger cages with 10 mice per cage for social adjustment. Two days before launch, they were divided into groups for the spaceflight and ground control experiments. All the mice ate a special food bar (NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars) during the study. The mice in space and their ground control counterparts were exposed to mold in their food, though the exact amount was unknown. There was also an issue where the food bars came loose in the cages, which could have caused the mice some stress. After returning from space, some mice were kept in crowded cages (10 mice per cage instead of 5) for longer than planned, which may have added stress. The mice that returned from space also may have experienced seasickness due to rough conditions during transportation.

    **Sample Collection (Liver Samples):**  
    For the mice that returned alive from space, they were put under anesthesia and humanely euthanized. Their livers were removed, weighed, and divided into parts, then quickly frozen. This process was done to ensure the liver samples were preserved for study. The same procedure was followed for the mice euthanized in space, except their bodies were frozen in space before being sent back to Earth for analysis.

    Transcriptional profiling of right extensor digitorum longus muscle from mice flown on the RR-23 mission
    Description
    The objective of the Rodent Research-23 mission (RR-23) was to better understand the effects of spaceflight on the eyes, specifically on the structure and function of the arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels that are needed to maintain vision. To this end, twenty male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks-old mice were delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-21 in a single transporter, transferred to two rodent habitats, and maintained in microgravity for 38 days. Flight mice were then returned to Earth alive (January 13th, 2021). After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, mice were transported to Kennedy Space Center via helicopter. The 20 Flight, 20 Habitat Ground Control (HGC), and 20 Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice were removed from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC), placed into shipping containers, and flown to Texas A and M University. There, mice underwent post-flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. Flight, HGC and VGC animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Right extensor digitorum longus muscle samples were preserved by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 150 bp). This dataset features 9 samples from the Flight group, 9 samples from the Habitat Ground Control group, and 9 samples from the Vivarium Ground Control group.

    Description
    Twenty (20) mice (male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 38 days. The Flight mice were transferred into a Transporter and returned to Earth for Live Animal Return (LAR) on SpX-21 (January 13th, 2021). After Atlantic Ocean splashdown, the LAR Flight mice were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 20 Flight, 20 HGC, and 20 VGC mice were transferred from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC) and placed into shipping containers. All 60 mice were flown via charter plane to the PI’s institution, Texas A and M University (TAMU). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR-23) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

    Protocol Type
    sample collection
    Description
    All post-flight euthanasia and dissections were performed by the PI team at TAMU. The original plan was to perform all pre-flight and post-flight activities at Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida. Due to the health risks associated with travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRP approved all post-flight activities at TAMU, which significantly decreased or eliminated travel for the PI, BSP, and Payload Developer (PD) teams. Upon arrival at the TAMU Animal Care Facility (ACF), the mice underwent post-flight procedures, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection by the PI team. GeneLab only processed 9/9/9 samples from Flight/HGC/VGC groups in this dataset.

    **Transcriptional profiling of right extensor digitorum longus muscle from mice flown on the RR-23 mission**

    **Description:**
    The goal of the Rodent Research-23 mission (RR-23) was to study how space affects the eyes, focusing on the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels that help maintain vision. To do this, 20 male mice (a specific breed called C57BL/6J) were sent to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a SpaceX flight. The mice were kept in weightlessness for 38 days. After their time in space, the mice were brought back to Earth and transported to Texas A&M University for examination. Tissue from their right leg muscle (called the extensor digitorum longus) was collected for analysis. Scientists used this tissue to study the genes being expressed in the muscle. The study also included two groups of mice that didn’t go to space for comparison—one group stayed on Earth in the same type of habitat used in space, and the other group stayed in regular lab conditions.

    **Protocols**

    **Animal Husbandry**
    Twenty male mice were launched on a SpaceX mission on December 6, 2020, to the ISS, where they stayed for 38 days in microgravity. After returning to Earth on January 13, 2021, the mice were flown to Texas A&M University for study. This research followed the guidelines for animal care, and the procedures were approved by NASA’s ethics committee.

    **Sample Collection**
    All post-flight procedures, including the humane euthanization and collection of tissue from the mice, were performed by the research team at Texas A&M University. Initially, these activities were planned to take place in Florida, but due to COVID-19, they were shifted to Texas to minimize travel risks.

    **Nucleic Acid Extraction**
    To extract RNA (genetic material) from the muscle tissue, a kit was used that helps break down the tissue into a liquid form. The tissue was then spun at high speed to remove debris, and the RNA was purified. The concentration and quality of the RNA were measured using specialized tools.

    **Spike-in Protocol**
    Extra RNA from another source (called ERCC Spike-In) was added during the library preparation stage to help control for any variations in the sequencing process.

    **Library Construction**
    To prepare the RNA for sequencing, certain parts of the RNA were removed, and the remaining RNA was processed using a special kit. The quality of this preparation was checked using advanced instruments. Two libraries (collections of RNA sequences) were made for three specific samples to ensure the results were reliable.

    **Nucleic Acid Sequencing**
    The RNA sequencing was performed using a machine that reads the RNA sequences. A control sample (PhiX) was included to ensure accuracy. 

    **Data Transformation**
    The raw data from the RNA sequencing was checked for quality and the presence of unwanted sequences like rRNA, which doesn’t provide the information the scientists are looking for. The data was processed using specific software to generate quality reports.
