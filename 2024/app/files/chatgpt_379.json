    "What was the main objective of this research study?": "The main objective of the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-1) was to assess the effects of spaceflight on mice, specifically looking at differences in outcomes based on age and duration in space, by examining liver RNA-seq data.",
    "Why is this study important for space science?": "This study is important for space science as it explores how spaceflight affects biological processes in organisms over time and across different ages, which can provide insights into the health effects of space travel, including potential impacts on astronauts of varying ages.",
    "What research question(s) is the study trying to answer?": "The study seeks to answer how spaceflight impacts biological outcomes based on age and exposure duration in space, particularly in terms of liver function and gene expression.",
    "What methods or techniques were used to collect the data?": "Ribodepleted total RNA-seq data was collected from liver samples dissected from mice. ERCC spike-in controls (Mix 1 or Mix 2) were included in all samples.",
    "What is the studyâ€™s experimental design or setup?": "The study used 40 female BALB/cAnNTac mice, divided by age (10-12 week-old and 32 week-old). Mice were further divided into two groups: one sacrificed on-orbit (ISS Terminal) after 22-23 days and another returned live to Earth and sacrificed after 2 days of recovery. Ground controls (flight hardware, matched environmental conditions), basal controls (sacrificed 1 day after launch), and vivarium controls (standard vivarium housing) were included, totaling 160 mice.",
    "Who or what were the subjects or participants in the study?": "The subjects were 160 female BALB/cAnNTac mice divided by age (10-12 weeks and 32 weeks) and by sacrifice timing (on-orbit or post-Earth recovery).",
    "How were the subjects or participants selected?": "Mice were selected based on age (10-12 week-old and 32 week-old) and randomly assigned to different experimental groups (ISS Terminal, Live Animal Return, ground controls, basal controls, and vivarium controls).",
    "What were the control or comparison groups in the study?": "Control groups included ground controls (mice housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (mice sacrificed 1 day after launch), and vivarium controls (mice housed in standard vivarium habitats).",
    "What methods or techniques were used to collect the data?": "Ribodepleted total RNA-seq from liver samples was used to collect data, including ERCC spike-in controls.",
    "What conclusions were drawn from the study?": "The text does not provide specific conclusions drawn from the study.",
    "What recommendations do the researchers make for future research?": "The text does not provide any recommendations for future research."
